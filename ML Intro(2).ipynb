Regularization introduces a penalty to the model's optimization objective, encouraging it to have simpler coefficients or parameters. This helps in reducing the model's complexity and improving its generalization ability to new, unseen data.\n",

    "3)Elastic Net Regularization:\n",

    "Dropout is a regularization technique for neural networks.\n",
    "During training, randomly selected neurons are dropped out (ignored) during forward and backward passes.\n",
